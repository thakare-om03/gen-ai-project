An AI-powered cold email generator for service companies that automates business development outreach. Built with GROQ, LangChain, and Streamlit to help sales teams create personalized cold emails by analyzing job listings and matching them with relevant portfolio items.

## Overview

This application streamlines the business development process by:

- Scraping job listings from multiple websites
- Extracting key requirements and skills using AI
- Generating tailored cold emails that highlight relevant portfolio items
- Automating the entire process through scheduling
